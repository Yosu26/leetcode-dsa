# 🎓 leetcode-dsa
A study log of my LeetCode journey to master data structures and algorithms.
This repository contains my curated solutions to LeetCode problems, following the [DSA roadmap from AlgoMaster.io](https://algomaster.io/practice/dsa-patterns). Problems are organized by topic in the order recommended by the roadmap to build strong foundations for technical interviews and competitive programming.
